# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is the systematic design, development, testing and maintaining of software systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
-Software engineering is the designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems
Differences
- Software Engineering focuses on producing a software that can be maintained and with a high quality
while in traditional programming, it aims to give a code that meets the requirements and a code that works
- Software Engineering follows the systematic approach that is design, development, testing and maintaining of systems while in traditional programming, it only focuses on code writing and debugging
- There is documentation and maintenance while in traditional programming, there is less focus on documentation.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
SDLC is a process used for developing software systems

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
PHASES
1. Planning- Setting the project goals and objectives and is achieved by conducting feasibility studies and project plans
2. Requirement Analysis- This is gathering the system and the user requirements by conducting interviews and survays
3. System Design- this is designing the system based on the requirements
4. Implementation- is coding the project
5. Testing- Checking whether the software works by conducting a unit test and system setting
6. Deployment- This is releasing the software to production
7. Maintenance- maintening the software by checking on bugs


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. 
- In processing, waterfall is Linear while agile is iterative
-In waterfall model, the risks are discovered late while in agile model, the risks are identified early
- waterfall doesnt really emphasise on team collaboration unlike Agile model which emphasise on team collaboration



What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

DIFFERENCES
- Waterfall is less adaptive to changes while agile is flexible and adapts to changes
- Waterfall limits customer involvement while agile requires a continous customer feedback and collaboration
- Testing in waterfall is done after implementation while in agile, there is a continous testing

SCENARIOS
- Waterfall can be prefered when creating an tool for a company with a stable business since the project is less prone to changes
- Waterfall can be prefered when creating a system that requires each phase to be completed first before going to the next phase
-Agile can be used to develop mobile apps where the user prefrerences can change from time to time
- 


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? 
- This is a phase in software development that involves identification, documentation, and management of the requirements for a system

Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

- Requirement gathering- gathering information from stakeholders to get their needs using surveys or conducting interviews
- Requirement analysis- this is analysing the gathered requirements and categorizing them into functional and non functional.
- Requirement specification- This is documenting the analyzed requitements into a detailed manner
- Requirement validation- checking whether the requirements that are documented meet the needs of the stakeholder
- Requirements management- This is managing the changes throughout the project

Importance
- There is a clear understanding of the stakeholder needs
- There is a better communication among developers and stakeholders 
- A higher quality software is produced due to a well defined requirements
- There is reduced development costs since issues are identified early and addressed

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
